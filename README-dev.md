📝 Survivor Journal – Form Status
✅ Current Setup
All submissions are now routed securely via Getform.io
Form data is not stored locally or rendered live—only accessible via Getform dashboard

🛠️ Future Work Needed
Re-enable DOM rendering of journal entries via backend (placeholder commented out in HTML near line 183)
Backend system to:
Persist entries
Moderate content (optional)
Display survivor stories dynamically
🎨 Tag Coloring – Future Styling Suggestion (Add to Dev README)
Existing survivor journal tags are uniformly styled. In future iterations, dynamically color code tags to reflect advocacy themes for greater emotional impact and clarity.

🏷️ Proposed Tag Palette
Tag	Color	Hex Code	Notes
Mental Health Journey	Blue	#4682B4	Stability, depth
Domestic Violence Survivor	Purple	#800080	Official DV awareness color
Sexual Assault Survivor	Teal	#008080	SA advocacy color
PTSD & Complex Trauma	Olive Green	#556B2F	Grounded, earthy, trauma-informed
Anxiety & Depression	Slate Gray	#708090	Calm, muted, reflective
Grief & Loss	Dusty Rose	#C08081	Tenderness, remembrance
Addiction Recovery	Bright Orange	#FF8C00	Energy, transformation
Healing as a Caregiver	Warm Gold	#DAA520	Light, honor, resilience
Other	Soft Lavender	#E6E6FA	Non-categorized, gentle identifier

🧠 Suggested Implementation
Add tag-specific classes (e.g., .tag-sexual-assault, .tag-grief, etc.)
Use dynamic CSS or backend rendering to assign classes based on content
Ensure WCAG-compliant contrast for accessibility

🧵 CSS: Emotionally-Resonant Tag Styling
Drop this block near the bottom of your stylesheet, or right after your existing .journal-tags li {} rules:

css
/* 🎨 Advocacy Tag Colors */
.tag-mental-health     { background-color: #4682B4; color: white; } /* Blue */
.tag-domestic-violence { background-color: #800080; color: white; } /* Purple */
.tag-sexual-assault    { background-color: #008080; color: white; } /* Teal */
.tag-ptsd-trauma       { background-color: #556B2F; color: white; } /* Olive Green */
.tag-anxiety-depression{ background-color: #708090; color: white; } /* Slate Gray */
.tag-grief-loss        { background-color: #C08081; color: white; } /* Dusty Rose */
.tag-addiction-recovery{ background-color: #FF8C00; color: white; } /* Bright Orange */
.tag-caregiver-healing { background-color: #DAA520; color: white; } /* Warm Gold */
.tag-other             { background-color: #E6E6FA; color: #333;   } /* Lavender */
You can customize the color: for text if any background needs better contrast.

🧪 How to Assign These Tags (HTML Usage)
In your journal entry block, format the <li> tags like this:

html
<li class="tag-sexual-assault">Sexual Assault Survivor</li>
<li class="tag-mental-health">Mental Health Journey</li>
If you're rendering dynamically later, your backend can assign the right class name based on tag content.

Suggested tools: Firebase, Supabase, Node.js API

Note: Previous JavaScript logic that injected journal entries client-side has been paused and moved to comments for future backend integration. See line 213 in Founding-Circle.html for full dev note.
