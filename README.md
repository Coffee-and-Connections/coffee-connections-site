# Coffee & Connections | El Paso Borderplex 
**A Vertically Integrated Ecosystem for Survivor Stability & Community Resilience.** 

## 🏙️ Project Vision
Coffee & Connections is a dual-engine social enterprise designed to bridge the gap between crisis and stability. Located at **216 E Overland**, this project integrates a trauma-informed "Sanctuary" Café with transitional safe-haven housing.

## 🏗️ Architectural Structure
The site is organized into three strategic pillars to reflect the physical and social infrastructure:

* **/cafe**: The Economic Engine. Features the Sanctuary Menu, Resilience Market, and the "Sanctuary Pour" pay-it-forward model.
* **/mission**: The Social Heart. Contains the Genesis story (Strong Bonds), the Healing in Motion archive, and the Founding Circle.
* **/overland**: The Strategic Prospectus. Housing the "Architecture of Stability" design philosophy and the Bridge @ Overland residential pitch.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & "Dual-Tower" Architecture
To ensure survivor safety and data integrity, the site utilizes a split-API infrastructure:

* **Tower 1: The Vault (Secure)** - A HIPAA-compliant environment (Node.js/Express) handling survivor narratives and crisis resources.
* **Tower 2: Public Commercial** - Handling retail operations, menu data, and community gamification.
* **Design System**: A custom "Sanctuary Palette" built on CSS Variables for low-glare, sensory-safe user experiences.

## 🤝 Governance: The Founding Circle
Our mission is guided by an **Open Table** governance model, ensuring lived experience and clinical expertise lead every decision:
* **Mental Health Chair:** NAMI El Paso (Strategic Partner)
* **Founding Supplier:** Ben “The Beanfather” Riley (Veteran Advocate)
* **Seats Open:** We are actively recruiting for Voice of Expression, Family Systems, and Policy Partners.

## 📝 Recent Milestone: Feb 2026 Refactor
* **Full Structural Migration**: Successfully moved to a multi-directory layout to support the Overland real estate prospectus.
* **Sanctuary Sync**: Standardized all 11+ CSS files to the core trauma-informed color palette.
* **Healing in Motion logic**: Activated the Digital Archive engine with functional page-turner mechanics and secure API hooks.
* **NAMI Integration**: Formally recognized NAMI El Paso as the Mental Health Chair following the receipt of the official Letter of Support.

## 🎨 Trauma-Informed Design System (NAMI-Aligned)
The visual interface is engineered for "Cognitive Ease" to support users who may be experiencing sensory overload or trauma-related stress.

* **Typography (The Legibility Engine):**
    * **Montserrat (Headers):** A geometric sans-serif that provides architectural stability and strength.
    * **Open Sans (Body):** A humanist sans-serif chosen for its "friendly" open apertures and high legibility, reducing the effort required to process information.
* **The Safety Buffer:** A global **0.25-inch (24px)** padding is enforced across all viewports. This creates essential "white space," preventing visual crowding and providing a psychological boundary for the user.
* **Visual Storytelling:** Mission-critical pages utilize a **Visual Novel / Storyboard** layout to break down complex survivor narratives into digestible, low-impact segments.
