🔒 Coffee & Connections | El Paso Borderplex
A Vertically Integrated Ecosystem for Survivor Stability & Community Resilience.

🏙️ Project Vision
Coffee & Connections is a dual-engine social enterprise designed to bridge the gap between crisis and stability. Located at 216 E Overland, this project integrates a trauma-informed "Sanctuary" Café with transitional safe-haven housing.

🏗️ Architectural Structure
The ecosystem is organized into three strategic pillars to reflect our physical and social infrastructure:

/cafe: The Economic Engine. Features the Sanctuary Menu, Resilience Market, and the "Sanctuary Pour" pay-it-forward model.

/mission: The Social Heart. Contains the Genesis story, the Healing in Motion interactive archive, and the Own Your Truth submission portal.

/overland: The Strategic Prospectus. Housing the "Architecture of Stability" design philosophy and the Bridge @ Overland residential pitch.

🛠️ Technical Stack: The "Dual-Tower" Architecture
To ensure survivor safety and data integrity, the site utilizes a split-API infrastructure managed via a central config.js gateway:

The Vault (Secure Tower): A high-security environment (Node.js/Express/MongoDB) handling survivor narratives and crisis resources. Includes an Interactive Submission Engine with color-coded advocacy identifiers.

Public Commercial Tower: Handles retail operations, menu data, and community engagement.

Design System: A custom "Sanctuary Palette" built on CSS Variables, engineered for low-glare, sensory-safe user experiences.

🛡️ Trauma-Informed Design System (NAMI-Aligned)
The visual interface is engineered for "Cognitive Ease" to support users who may be experiencing sensory overload or trauma-related stress.

Typography: Montserrat (Architectural Stability) and Open Sans (Humanist Legibility).

The Safety Buffer: A global 24px (0.25in) padding is enforced to prevent visual crowding and provide psychological boundaries.

Identity Tags: Integrated color-coded advocacy identifiers (#Teal for SA, #Purple for DV, #Green for PTSD) to foster immediate community recognition.

🤝 Governance
Our mission is guided by an Open Table governance model, ensuring lived experience leads every decision.

Mental Health Chair: NAMI El Paso (Strategic Partner)

Founding Supplier: Ben “The Beanfather” Riley (Veteran Advocate)
