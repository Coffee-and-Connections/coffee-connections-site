Using humble art and honest narration, it introduces the vision behind Coffee & Connections—a space where strangers become family, and recovery begins with one open seat.</p>
      <p>It’s not just about coffee. It’s about <strong>connection that doesn’t come with conditions</strong>. And <strong>belonging that doesn’t ask for explanation</strong>.</p>

    <div class="story-left reveal">
      <h3>Anthony’s Story</h3>
      <p class="story-stinger">“I didn’t set out to build a café. I set out to die.”</p>
      <div class="story-section">
        <p><strong>Now, my goal is to make sure no one faces that decision alone.</strong></p>
        <p>In November of 2023, I took 10,000mg of sleeping pills. It wasn’t a gesture—it was an exit. Years of carrying trauma, pain, and watching soldiers I was responsible for break under the weight of a system that should’ve protected them… it hollowed me out.</p>
        <p>After deployments, I was diagnosed with PTSD—like thousands who’ve worn the uniform—but what hurt more than my back or neck was the silence. The isolation. The feeling that rank mattered more than humanity. I’d seen the support systems crumble under their own apathy. And eventually, I stopped believing there was a way forward.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">But the pills didn’t take me. I woke up. I was alive.</span></p>
        <p>That survival wasn’t a miracle—it was a question. <em>Why am I still here? What now?</em></p>
        <p>What followed wasn’t a plan. It was a need. I went back to something simple—coffee. And the ritual of it reminded me: there’s power in showing up, even when you don’t want to.</p>
        <p>So at first, the idea was to open a shop. Just a place to be. But when I brought it to Marylou, she said what I hadn’t dared to hope: <strong>what if the coffee shop could be more?</strong></p>
        <p>From that conversation, Coffee & Connections was born—a trauma-informed café and digital sanctuary for the ones who’ve been called too broken, too angry, too late. Veterans. Survivors. Everyday people trying to heal in a world that doesn’t give them the space to do so.</p>
        <p>Later, I wrote my “words to live by.” They weren’t affirmations—they were the suicide note that didn’t get used. <span class="highlight">Now, they’re the compass. They guide everything we’re building.</span></p>
        <p>This café is the place I wish had existed that morning. Where being “not okay” gets met with real support. Where stories get to land softly. Where survival isn’t the end—it’s the invitation.</p>
        <p>And now, I get to build it—with people who see dignity not as a reward, but as a baseline. That’s why Coffee & Connections must exist. And why I’m still here to make sure it does.</p>
        <p><strong>This is how Coffee & Connections was born—from fire, from failures, from love for people who deserve to feel safe again.</strong></p>

  <h3>Marylou’s Story</h3>
  <p class="story-stinger">“I didn’t think my art would ever be seen. Now it’s saving lives.”</p>
  <div class="story-section">
    <p><strong>I wore the uniform too.</strong> I joined at 17, excited to start a new journey in my life. But the trauma I survived wasn't on a battlefield like Tony's. It was within the walls of my own unit—<span class="highlight">multiple sexual assaults before and after being deployed overseas.</span></p>
    <p>The trauma followed me home and severely affected my work. So did the silence of figuring out how to realistically cope alone. There were suicide attempts. Pain misread as “weakness” and more blame than I'd already felt cast towards me. And still, I stayed in service. I enjoyed my job, but living with what had happened to me made life so empty and miserable, especially with family so far away.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Until the final assault happened again in the barracks.</span> After yet another stay in the hospital, my command’s solution to “keeping me safe” was restricting me in my room and limiting time for hobbies I relied on for distraction.</p>
    <p>Then they quietly pushed me out—chaptered me out of the Army without follow-up, without wraparound care. Even more isolating, no one from my unit reached back out to me once I was gone, not even a phone call to see if I was recovering.</p>
    <p><strong>Just like that, I was gone from the system. But not from this mission.</strong></p>
    <p>I am now co-founder—and together, we built this space so no one else has to feel that kind of cold.</p>
