                <h2>Short-Term Stabilization Plan</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The Bridge @ Overland is designed as an <strong>Active Reintegration Runway</strong>. We are transforming the top two floors into a high-support living environment funded through HUD and State rental assistance programs. This sanctuary is designed to be a <strong>low-friction, secure harbor</strong> where survivors can stabilize their surroundings and gather the momentum needed to transition into permanent, independent housing.</p>
            
            <ul class="spec-list">
                <li><strong>The Runway Model:</strong> Stays are goal-oriented (typically 1 to 6 months) to ensure residents are moving toward independent living, not permanent residency.</li>
                <li><strong>HUD/State Funding:</strong> We leverage government housing vouchers and grants to ensure all rent is covered while residents focus on stabilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Safe Sightlines:</strong> Architectural layout is designed to eliminate blind corners and reduce survivor hypervigilance.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <p>Stabilization requires more than just a bed. We connect our residents with an elite network of on-site professional partners to resolve the issues that lead to housing instability.</p>
            
            <ul class="spec-list">

                <li><strong>Financial Resilience:</strong> Certified planners help residents manage their state vouchers and build a sustainable "Launch Budget."</li>
