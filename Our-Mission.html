<section class="mission-hero">
  <h1>“Coffee & Connections is a sanctuary—where safety lives before healing begins.”</h1>
  
  <p class="mission-subtext">
    We didn't build this to serve coffee. We built it because too many of us found pain before we ever found safety.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Marylou survived trauma</strong> inside a system that tried to silenced her. <strong>Tony almost died</strong> at his own hand to show how deeply it was broken.
    <br><br>
    This space was born from that fire—from stories no one wanted to hear, and lives no one <strong>cared to try to save.</strong>

<!-- 💬 Founders' Message -->
<section class="mission-founders">
  <h2>From the Founders</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “We didn’t build this to fix broken people. We built it to say:
    <br>👉 It’s okay to not be okay.
    <br>👉 You don’t need to explain your pain to be worthy of community.
    <br>👉 Blame is not our language—belonging is.”
  </blockquote>
