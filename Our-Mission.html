  <h1>“Coffee & Connections is a sanctuary—<br>where safety lives before healing begins.”</h1>
  
  <p class="mission-subtext">
    We didn't build this to serve coffee. We built it because too many of us found pain before we ever found safety.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Marylou survived trauma</strong> inside a system that tried to silenced her. <strong>Tony almost died</strong> at his own hand to show how deeply it was broken.
    <br><br>
    This space was born from that fire—from stories no one wanted to hear, and lives no one <strong>cared to try to save.</strong>

<!-- 🛤️ The Origin Journey -->
<section class="mission-origin">

    <h2>Where It Started</h2>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        It started in a car. Tony had been thinking about what life might look like after the Army. His love of coffee sparked an idea: 
        <strong>“I should open a coffee shop.”</strong> 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        One day, on the way to or from an intensive group trauma therapy appointment, Marylou said: 
        <strong>“What if you tied your coffee shop to mental health?”</strong> 
        A simple sentence. And an idea was born.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        What if we took all the pain—all the missed opportunities where someone could've helped us—and turned that original idea into a bridge? 
        <strong>A space that caught people before the crisis.</strong> 
        A space where saying “I'm not okay” wasn’t a liability... but an opening.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        A place where someone who's walked through the fire says: 
        <em>“You're not alone. We got you.”</em> 
        Even if that means just sitting with them. Listening. Or helping them find the help they need <strong>right now</strong>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        We're not building a coffee shop. <strong>We're building the space we wished we had when we needed it most.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>
