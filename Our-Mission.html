  <h1>“Coffee & Connections is a sanctuary—<br>where safety lives before healing begins.”</h1>
  
  <p class="mission-subtext">
    We didn't build this to serve coffee. We built it because too many of us found pain before we ever found safety.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Marylou survived trauma</strong> inside a system that tried to silence her. <strong>Tony almost died</strong> at his own hand to show how deeply it was broken.
    <br><br>
    This space was born from that fire—from stories no one wanted to hear, and lives no one <strong>cared to try to save.</strong>

<!-- 🛤️ The Origin Journey -->
<section class="mission-origin">
  <div class="origin-left">
    <h2>Where It Started</h2>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        It started in a car. Tony had been thinking about what life might look like after the Army. His love of coffee sparked an idea: 
        <strong>“I should open a coffee shop.”</strong> 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        One day, on the way to or from an intensive group trauma therapy appointment, Marylou said: 
        <strong>“What if you tied your coffee shop to mental health?”</strong> 
        A simple sentence. And an idea was born.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        What if we took all the pain—all the missed opportunities where someone could've helped us—and turned that original idea into a bridge? 
        <strong>A space that caught people before the crisis.</strong> 
        A space where saying “I'm not okay” wasn’t a liability... but an opening.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        A place where someone who's walked through the fire says: 
        <em>“You're not alone. We got you.”</em> 
        Even if that means just sitting with them. Listening. Or helping them find the help they need <strong>right now</strong>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        We're not building a coffee shop. <strong>We're building the space we wished we had when we needed it most.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        In the military and mental health systems, we saw things we couldn't unsee—<strong>people discarded</strong>, <strong>support delayed</strong>, and stigma so heavy it made saying “I'm not okay” feel almost criminal.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        So we decided to act. We’re filling those cracks with cement made from <strong>community, understanding, and love</strong>. 
        The kind built with open hands, not intake forms. 
        The kind that says: <em>“Your story—no matter what it is, or where you are in it—is safe here.”</em>
      </p>

<!-- 🎯 Mission Pillars -->
<section class="mission-pillars">
  <h2>Our Guiding Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>☕ Comfort First:</strong>  
      Coffee is a ritual—a warmth offered, not sold. Every cup is a gesture of care.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>👥 Belonging Before Bureaucracy:</strong>  
      We don't need paperwork or forms to welcome you, listen to you, or lend a helping hand.  
      At Coffee & Connections, we see the person, their story, their lived truth.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>🧠 Trauma-Informed Always:</strong>  
      From how we greet you to how our chairs are arranged—we build with your nervous system in mind.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>🎯 Governance with Heart:</strong>  
      We reject hierarchy that harms. Every decision is shaped by shared voice, transparency, and dignity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>🎮 Joy Is Resistance:</strong>  
      Our gaming rooms aren’t just for Magic: The Gathering or Dungeons & Dragons—they’re landing pads for laughter, community, and self-expression.  
      Joy isn’t a luxury here—it’s a healing force.
    </li>
  </ul>

<!-- ✍️ Founders' Message -->
<section class="mission-founders">
  <p><strong>From Anthony:</strong><br>
    I tried to die to make someone care.  
    Now I live to make sure no one feels alone again.
  </p>

  <p><strong>From Marylou:</strong><br>
    I survived what never should’ve happened.  
    So now I build what never existed—a space that sees the whole person before the crisis.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Together:</strong><br>
    This mission was born in pain—but it’s rooted in people.  
    We built this for you. Not for clicks. Not for praise. But for connection.  
    If this moved you, you belong in the Founding Circle—not just as a supporter, but as someone who helps hold this ground.
