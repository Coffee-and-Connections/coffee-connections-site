            <div class="narrative-block">
                <p>It started in a car. Tony had been thinking about what life might look like after the Army. His love of coffee sparked an idea: <em>“I should open a coffee shop.”</em></p>
                <p>One day, on the way to or from intensive group trauma therapy, Marylou said: <strong>“What if you tied your coffee shop to mental health?”</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>We turned that pain into a bridge. A space that catches people <strong>before the crisis</strong>. A space where saying “I'm not okay” isn’t a liability... but an opening.</p>
