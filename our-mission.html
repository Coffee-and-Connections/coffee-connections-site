        We didn't build this to serve coffee. We built it because too many of us found pain before we ever found safety.

      <h2 class="story-heading">Where It Started</h2>
      
      <p class="story-text">
        It started in a car. Tony had been thinking about what life might look like after the Army. His love of coffee sparked an idea: <span class="highlight-text">“I should open a coffee shop.”</span>
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        One day, on the way to or from an intensive group trauma therapy appointment, Marylou said: <span class="highlight-text">“What if you tied your coffee shop to mental health?”</span> A simple sentence. And an idea was born.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        What if we took all the pain—all the missed opportunities where someone could've helped us—and turned that original idea into a bridge? A space that caught people <strong>before the crisis</strong>. A space where saying “I'm not okay” wasn’t a liability... but an opening.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        We're not building a coffee shop. We're building the space we wished we had when we needed it most.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        In the military and mental health systems, we saw things we couldn't unsee—people discarded, support delayed, and stigma so heavy it made asking for help feel criminal. So we decided to act. We’re filling those cracks with cement made from community, understanding, and love.
