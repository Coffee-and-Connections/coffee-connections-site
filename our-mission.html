        <p>We didn't build this to serve coffee. We built it because too many of us found pain before we ever found safety.</p>
        <p>
          Marylou survived trauma inside a system that tried to silence her.<br>
          Tony almost died at his own hand to show how deeply it was broken.
        </p>
        <p><strong>This space was born from that fire—from stories no one wanted to hear, and lives no one cared to try to save.</strong></p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="origin-story">
      <h3>Where It Started</h3>
      <p>
        It started in a car. Tony had been thinking about what life might look like after the Army. His love of coffee sparked an idea: <em>“I should open a coffee shop.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, on the way to or from an intensive group trauma therapy appointment, Marylou said: 
        <strong>“What if you tied your coffee shop to mental health?”</strong> 
        A simple sentence. And an idea was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if we took all the pain—all the missed opportunities where someone could've helped us—and turned that original idea into a bridge? 
        A space that caught people <strong>before the crisis</strong>. A space where saying “I'm not okay” wasn’t a liability... but an opening.
      </p>
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>
          A place where someone who's walked through the fire says: 
          <strong>“You're not alone. We got you.”</strong> 
          Even if that means just sitting with them. Listening. Or helping them find the help they need right now.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        We're not building a coffee shop. We're building the space we wished we had when we needed it most.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="the-solution">
      <p>
        In the military and mental health systems, we saw things we couldn't unsee—people discarded, support delayed, and stigma so heavy it made saying “I'm not okay” feel almost criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we decided to act. We’re filling those cracks with cement made from community, understanding, and love. The kind built with open hands, not intake forms. 
        The kind that says: <strong>“Your story—no matter what it is, or where you are in it—is safe here.”</strong>

      <h3>Our Guiding Principles</h3>
      <div class="principles-grid">
        
        <div class="principle-card">
          <h4>☕ Comfort First</h4>
          <p>Coffee is a ritual—a warmth offered, not sold. Every cup is a gesture of care.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
          <h4>👥 Belonging Before Bureaucracy</h4>
          <p>We don't need paperwork or forms to welcome you. We see the person, their story, their lived truth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
          <h4>🧠 Trauma-Informed Always</h4>
          <p>From how we greet you to how our chairs are arranged—we build with your nervous system in mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
          <h4>🎯 Governance with Heart</h4>
          <p>We reject hierarchy that harms. Every decision is shaped by shared voice, transparency, and dignity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
          <h4>🎮 Joy Is Resistance</h4>
          <p>Our gaming rooms are landing pads for laughter and self-expression. Joy isn’t a luxury here—it’s a healing force.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
          <h4>🌍 Context Creates Clarity</h4>
          <p>We honor the layers of lived truth—history, identity, and culture. Every story carries weight, and we make space for all of it.</p>
        </div>
