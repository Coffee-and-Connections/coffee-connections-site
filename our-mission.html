        <h2>Born From Fire</h2>
        <p>
          We didn't build this to serve coffee. We built it because too many of us found pain before we ever found safety.
          <br><br>
          Marylou survived trauma inside a system that tried to silence her. Tony almost died at his own hand to show how deeply it was broken.
          <br><br>
          This space was born from that fire—from stories no one wanted to hear, and lives no one cared to try to save.
        </p>

      <div class="story-block">
        <h2>The Spark</h2>
        <p>
          It started in a car. Tony had been thinking about what life might look like after the Army. His love of coffee sparked an idea: <em>“I should open a coffee shop.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, on the way to a trauma therapy appointment, Marylou said: 
          <br>
          <strong class="highlight-text">“What if you tied your coffee shop to mental health?”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A simple sentence. And an idea was born. What if we took all the pain—all the missed opportunities—and turned them into a bridge? A space that caught people <em>before</em> the crisis.
