    We didn't build this to serve coffee.<br>
    We built it because too many of us found pain before we ever found safety.

<!-- 🛤️ The Origin Journey -->
<section class="mission-origin" aria-label="The Origin Journey">
  <div class="origin-left">
    <h2 class="origin-title">Where It Started</h2>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        It started in a car. Tony had been thinking about what life might look like after the Army.
        His love of coffee sparked an idea:
        <span class="mission-emphasis">“I should open a coffee shop.”</span>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        One day, on the way to or from an intensive group trauma therapy appointment, Marylou said:
        <span class="mission-emphasis">“What if you tied your coffee shop to mental health?”</span>
        A simple sentence. And an idea was born.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        What if we took all the pain—all the missed opportunities where someone could've helped us—
        and turned that original idea into a bridge?
        <span class="mission-emphasis">A space that caught people before the crisis.</span>
        A space where saying “I'm not okay” wasn’t a liability... but an opening.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        A place where someone who's walked through the fire says:
        <em>“You're not alone. We got you.”</em>
        Even if that means just sitting with them. Listening. Or helping them find the help they need
        <span class="truth-strike">right now</span>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        We're not building a coffee shop.
        <span class="mission-emphasis">We're building the space we wished we had when we needed it most.</span>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        In the military and mental health systems, we saw things we couldn't unsee—
        <span class="callout-emotion">people discarded</span>, <span class="callout-emotion">support delayed</span>,
        and stigma so heavy it made saying “I'm not okay” feel almost criminal.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        So we decided to act. We’re filling those cracks with cement made from
        <span class="mission-emphasis">community, understanding, and love</span>.
        The kind built with open hands, not intake forms. The kind that says:
        <em>“Your story—no matter what it is, or where you are in it—is safe here.”</em>
      </p>
    </div>

<!-- 🎯 Mission Pillars -->
<section class="mission-pillars" aria-label="Our Guiding Principles">
  <h2 class="pillars-title">Our Guiding Principles</h2>
  <ul class="pillars-list">
    <li>
      <span class="pillar-label">☕ Comfort First:</span><br>
      Coffee is a ritual—a warmth offered, not sold. Every cup is a gesture of care.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="pillar-label">👥 Belonging Before Bureaucracy:</span><br>
      We don't need paperwork or forms to welcome you, listen to you, or lend a helping hand.<br>
      At Coffee & Connections, we see the person, their story, their lived truth.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="pillar-label">🧠 Trauma-Informed Always:</span><br>
      From how we greet you to how our chairs are arranged—we build with your nervous system in mind.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="pillar-label">🎯 Governance with Heart:</span><br>
      We reject hierarchy that harms. Every decision is shaped by shared voice, transparency, and dignity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="pillar-label">🎮 Joy Is Resistance:</span><br>
      Our gaming rooms aren’t just for Magic: The Gathering or Dungeons & Dragons—they’re landing pads for laughter, community, and self-expression.<br>
      Joy isn’t a luxury here—it’s a healing force.
    </li>
